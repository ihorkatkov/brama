# Brama Library Specifications

## Overview

This document serves as an index for all specification documents related to the Brama library, which provides reliable connection management with external dependencies.

Brama is designed to act as a gatekeeper for your application's interactions with external systems. It monitors connection statuses, implements circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures, and provides self-healing mechanisms and notifications for connection status changes.

## Development Roadmap

This specification will evolve as development progresses. Implementation priorities:

1. Core connection monitoring and registry functionality
2. Basic circuit breaking mechanism
3. Expiry strategies (fixed and progressive)
4. Status notification system
5. Function decorator API for seamless integration
6. Event subscription and delivery system
7. Telemetry integration
8. Advanced configuration options
9. Documentation and examples

The development will follow an iterative approach, starting with the core functionality and progressively adding features while maintaining backward compatibility.
