# Brama Library Specifications

## Overview

This document serves as an index for all specification documents related to the Brama library, which provides reliable connection management with external dependencies.

Brama is designed to act as a gatekeeper for your application's interactions with external systems. It monitors connection statuses, implements circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures, and provides self-healing mechanisms and notifications for connection status changes.

## Development Roadmap

This specification will evolve as development progresses. The initial focus will be on implementing:

1. Core connection monitoring functionality
2. Basic circuit breaking mechanism
3. Simple status notification system
4. Function decorator API for seamless integration

Subsequent development will enhance these features and add more advanced capabilities.
